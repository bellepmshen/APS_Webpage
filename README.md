# Truck Air Pressure System Failures Predictor

By training a machine learning model for predictive maintenance,it can prevent from machines or parts failures in advance and saves a lot of down time and costs in industries.

In this project, I built an ensemble model (Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Tree & Random Forest) and achieved precision and recall scores of 93% and 71% respectively.

Here are the main files building this ensemble model.

    a. features.py: This file is for feature selections.
    b. logist.py: This file is for building a Logistic Regression Model.
    c. tree_models.py: This file is for building Gradient Boosting & Random Forest Models.
    d. main.py: This file is for running the main code.
