# Data Science Project: Truck Air Pressure System Failures Predictor

In this project, I built an ensemble model (Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Tree & Random Forest) and achieved precision and recall scores of 93% and 71% respectively.

This repository is currently building and the following files are ready.

    a. features.py: This file is for feature selections.
    b. logist.py: This file is for building a Logistic Regression Model.
    c. main.py: This file is for running the main code.

More files will be coming soon....
